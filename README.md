# Templates
Generic letter, will be customized and personalized

Hello $username

stdlib has 2 packages:  

* text/template - foundation for the second
* html/templates

go run main.go > index.html

## text/template

.gohtml - custom file extension, not mandatory, can be changed to any extension. I'll be using html, just because code editors can use appropriate tools

### Parsing files 

```tmp := template.ParseFiles(...files)``` - creates a container holding templates

```tmp = tmp.ParseFiles(...files)``` - adds templates to the container

tmp.ParseGlob

Must() does error checking

Parse -> Execute

### Sending data

```{{.}}``` - the current piece of data

When passing struct, make sure the data is exported(starts with upper case)

Passing function to templates is good to modify data. Functions must be passed before the template is parsed.

Time formating depends on the number that are typed in.

Pipelining - passing value from one function to another

To pass template:
```
{{define "templateName"}}
{{end}}

{{template "templateName"}}
```

Methods(functions with receivers) can be used in a template

## State

State - persistent awareness of who is communicating with whom 

## Enctype

When a form allows to upload a file: use enctype = "multipart/form-data"
